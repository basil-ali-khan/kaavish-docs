This chapter provides detailed specifications of the system under development.

% \section{Functional Requirements}

% This section describes each function/feature provided by our system. These functions are logically grouped into modules based on their purpose/users/mode of operations etc (as per our system). A functional hierarchy may look like:
% \begin{outline}
%     \1 Module 1:
%     \2 Function 1:
%     \2 Function 2:
%     \3 Sub Function 1
%     \3 Sub Function 2
%     \1 Module 2:
%     \2 Function 1:
%     \2 Function 2:
%     \1 .........
% \end{Doutline}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
This section defines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the AI-powered Operations Agent for payment switch systems at TPS. Targets are framed as SLOs/SLAs where applicable and assume deployment within TPS's PCI-DSS compliant environment and integration with the payment switch.

\begin{enumerate}

% --- Performance ---
\item \textbf{Performance:} The system shall ingest and parse log entries within \textbf{500 milliseconds} of event generation.
\item The system shall detect and raise critical anomaly alerts within \textbf{60 seconds} of the pattern's occurrence.
\item The main user dashboard shall load in under \textbf{3 seconds}, and log queries shall return in under \textbf{5 seconds}.

% --- Security ---
\item \textbf{Security:} The system shall enforce strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all users and API endpoints.
\item The system shall encrypt all data using strong, current protocols (e.g., \textbf{TLS 1.2+} in transit, \textbf{AES-256} at rest).
\item The system shall generate tamper-evident audit trails (per PCI DSS 10.5) for all user and automated actions.

% --- Reliability & Availability ---
\item \textbf{Reliability \& Availability:} The core data ingestion and alerting pipeline shall maintain \textbf{99.99\% uptime} ("four nines").
\item The system shall be fault-tolerant, with no single component failure causing a full-system outage.
\item The remediation layer shall include circuit breakers (e.g., max \textbf{3 automated restarts} per service in 15 minutes).

% --- Scalability ---
\item \textbf{Scalability:} The system shall scale horizontally to support a \textbf{10x increase} in log volume from baseline (e.g., for seasonal surges).
\item The system shall support ingestion of tens of thousands of log entries per second (EPS) during peak loads.

% --- Usability ---
\item \textbf{Usability:} The alert correlation engine must achieve a \textbf{90\% reduction} in actionable alerts compared to raw anomaly events.
\item A new operator shall be able to independently triage a critical alert using the dashboard within \textbf{20 minutes} of training.

% --- Compliance ---
\item \textbf{Compliance:} The system shall be designed to support and automate key logging requirements of \textbf{PCI DSS (Req 10)}.
\item The system shall enforce data residency, ensuring data is processed and stored only within its designated geopolitical region.

% --- Data Integrity & Backup ---
\item \textbf{Data Integrity \& Backup:} The system shall prevent any unauthorized modification or deletion of original log data.
\item The system shall retain log data for at least \textbf{one year}, with the last \textbf{three months} available for immediate query.
\item System configuration (models, rules) shall be backed up daily (\textbf{RPO: 24 hours}) and be restorable within \textbf{4 hours} (\textbf{RTO: 4 hours}).
