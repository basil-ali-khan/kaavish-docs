This chapter provides detailed specifications of the system under development.

% \section{Functional Requirements}

% This section describes each function/feature provided by our system. These functions are logically grouped into modules based on their purpose/users/mode of operations etc (as per our system). A functional hierarchy may look like:
% \begin{outline}
%   \1 Module 1:
%   \2 Function 1:
%   \2 Function 2:
%   \3 Sub Function 1
%   \3 Sub Function 2
%   \1 Module 2:
%   \2 Function 1:
%   \2 Function 2:
%   \1 .........
% \end{outline}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

% --- Log Ingestion & Processing ---
\item \textbf{Log Ingestion \& Processing:} The system must ingest logs from masked data sources provided by TPS.
\item The system shall support structured, semi-structured, and unstructured log formats.
\item The system shall parse logs in real-time and extract relevant fields.
\item The system shall maintain historical logs for analysis and learning.

% --- Anomaly Detection ---
\item \textbf{Anomaly Detection:} The system shall detect anomalies in logs using machine learning models.
\item The system shall classify anomalies by severity.
\item The system shall detect unseen anomalies not covered by rules.
\item The system shall generate anomaly alerts in real time.

% --- Predictive Analytics ---
\item \textbf{Predictive Analytics:} The system shall analyze historical logs to identify recurring patterns.
\item The system shall forecast system failures.

% --- Incident Recommendation Engine ---
\item \textbf{Incident Recommendation Engine:} The system shall recommend remediation actions.
\item The system shall allow operators to approve, reject, or modify actions.

% --- Automated Safe Actions ---
\item \textbf{Automated Safe Actions:} The system shall perform predefined low-risk automated actions.
\item The system shall require human approval for high-impact actions.
\item The system shall log all automated actions. (TBD)

% --- Human-in-the-Loop Interface ---
\item \textbf{Human-in-the-Loop Interface:} The system shall provide a web-based dashboard.
\item The dashboard shall show anomalies, system health, and predictions.
\item The dashboard shall allow operators to approve AI suggestions.
\item The dashboard shall support log viewing and filtering.
\item The system shall let operators provide feedback to improve models. (TBD)

% --- Alerting & Notifications ---
\item \textbf{Alerting \& Notifications:} The system shall send alerts for critical anomalies.
\item The system shall support email and in-dashboard notifications.
% --- Security & Compliance ---
\item \textbf{Security \& Compliance:} The system shall mask sensitive data.
\item The system shall enforce role-based authentication.
\item The system shall maintain audit logs for actions and decisions.

% % --- System Configuration & Monitoring ---
% \item \textbf{System Configuration \& Monitoring:} The system shall allow administrators to configure policies and thresholds.
% \item The system shall provide performance and health metrics.

% % --- Data Sources & Environment ---
% \item \textbf{Data Sources \& Environment:} The system shall run in a secure sandbox environment.
% \item The system shall support TPS datasets and public benchmark datasets.
\end{enumerate}

% --- The above is to be modified as per your project, e.g. a flat list if your system has limited functional requirements.

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

This sections mentions the specific non-functional requirements of our system. These generally address performance, scalability, safety, availability, deployment etc.

\section{External Interfaces}

We expect every project to have at least of the following subsections. This section must be aligned with your project deliverables. Please consult with your project supervisor regarding which of the following section(s) you should include in your report

\subsection{User Interfaces}
This section includes our mockup screens and briefly explains them.

\subsection{Application Program Interface (API)}
This section describes the library or API interface to our system.

\subsection{Hardware/Communication Interfaces}
This section describes our project's specific hardware/network interfaces.

\section{Use Cases}
This section presents detailed use cases of our system.

\section{Datasets}
This section describes the specific dataset(s) used to build our system. An appropriate snapshot of the dataset(s) is also included. Futher details, when needed, are presented in the appendix.

\section{System Diagram}
This diagram gives a high-level view of the different components of our system and the interactions between them. Each component and the particular tools/technologies/libraries used to build it are described.
